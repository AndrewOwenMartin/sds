Stochastic Diffusion Search (SDS) is a swarm intelligence algorithm. It has many interesting features, most significantly its simplicity, and the speed of its performance over suitable problems.

To see an animation that may help you to understand the process, `go here <http://www.aomartin.co.uk/sds-animation/>`_.

A suitable problem is search problem where the value of each solution can be estimated from the value of a number of quick and simple tests. The quicker and simpler the tests, the better. SDS is very tolerant of noise, so it tends to be more suitable in real-world problems rather than theoretical problems.
